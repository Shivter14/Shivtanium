## Shivtanium is a Batch OS subsystem, along with BatchWindows and `bxf` making it the ultimate Batch OS.
(Screenshots are avaliable at the bottom of this document.)
</div>

Shivtanium has a process manager which allows it to do true multi tasking (aka. having multiple windows open).

A process is a running asynchronous batch file. Communication is done via _file pipe streams_, 
and an API made with BXF (Batch Expanded Functions Compiler).

the Shivtanium subsystem handles:

- Process management

- Registering windows

- Moving windows

- Resizing windows

- Automatically deleting windows when their process exits

- Shutdown & Rebooting

Shivtanium has a compiler called BXF, which adds expanded functions that don't have to be called along with import commands, and standard libraries. These files have the `.bxf` extension.

Shivtanium also has desktop environments. The default & original one is `systemb`. You can find screenshots at the bottom of this document.

Graphics & windows are handled by BatchWindows. It uses many kinds of VT sequences, optimizations, and all sorts of techniques in order to render windows quickly and smoothly.

## BatchWindows - The Desktop Window Manager

Shivtanium uses a custom-made Desktop Window Manager to render windows with themes.
These themes can be customized with resource packs.

Creating themes requires VT100 knowledge.
Themes located in: `C\Shivtanium\resourcepacks\init\themes\`

Here is a basic theme example:
```
scene=[0m[48;2;58;110;155;38;5;231m[H[2JClassic theme
sceneBGcolor=2;58;110;155
BGcolor=2;229;227;222
FGcolor=5;16
TIcolor=5;247
TTcolor=5;231
NIcolor=5;8
NTcolor=5;7
CBUI=[48;5;8;38;5;231m -  â–¡  Ã— 
aero=
winAero=
```
- `scene` is the background. It should contain VT sequences that erase the screen.
- `sceneBGcolor` is the color for the background. Since BatchWindows uses window moving techniques that don't redraw the background, a generic background color is needed.

- `BGcolor` is the background color for a window.
- `FGcolor` is the foreground color for a window.
- `TIcolor` is the *accent color* of the window, which is used for the title bar, buttons, and more graphical elements.
- `TTcolor` is the *second accent color* of the window, which is used for the window title, button labels, and more.

- `NIcolor` is a replacement for `TIcolor`, when the window is unfocused. Setting it to nothing disables this feature.
- `NTcolor` is a replacement for `TTcolor`, same as above.
- `CBUI` is the Window Control UI Elements.

- `aero` is an arithmetic equasion that is used for calculating an RGB color for a line in the background.
  - It should define 3 values: `r`, `g`, `b`
  - The value of the current line being generated is `x`.
- `winAero` is similar to `aero`, but it applies to window backgrounds. If set to nothing, `aero` is used instead.

* To modify the window button controls, change the `CBUI` value which should add 9 characters. If more are needed, `\e[#E` can be used to expand the limit by # characters.

* For more help, head to the [BatchWindows Wiki](https://github.com/Shivter14/Shivtanium/wiki/Desktop-Window-Manager).

It's even easier to create sprites, it's just raw ASCII art located in: `C\Shivtanium\resourcepacks\init\sprites\`

The sprite loader automatically detects and assigns the width of sprites while loading.


## Keyboard & typing

Shivtanium uses a keyboard layout system, where the keyboard layout is a batch file located in the resource pack:
`keyboard_init.bat`

This batch file may contain 3 variable definitions:

- `charset_L` - Lower case (keycode -> Character)

- `charset_U` - Upper case (Shift + keycode -> Upper case character)

- `charset_A` - Alternative (Alt + keycode -> Alternative character)

> The variable definitions are long strings containing all the possible characters that can be input.

> You can get a character from a character set using the following expansion method: `!charset_#:~<keycode>,1!`

> Keycode is a keyboard key value from WinAPI (used in: getInput64.dll, cmdwiz.exe, getInput.exe, radish.exe...)

Example: `A` is pressed without `Shift` nor `Alt`;

- Keycode of `A` is 65.

- Result: `!charset_L:~65,1!`

Modifying the keyboard layout can be done in the following way:

* Open the `keyboard_init.bat` file in the specified resource pack. (default: `init`)
* Change one of the character sets. (`charset_L` - Lower case, `charset_U` - Upper case, `charset_A` - Alternative)
* To *re-bind* a key to a different character, find the character, and replace it with a different one.
* To *bind a key by its keycode*, change the character at the position based on the keycode.

  (Example: Keycode of `F1` is 112; go to the 112th place.)

## How can I create interactive batch scripts compatible with Shivtanium?

With help from the Shivtanium Kernel;

Information about creating applications for Shivtanium can be found on the [Kernel Wiki](https://github.com/Shivter14/Shivtanium/wiki/kernel). (In progress)
